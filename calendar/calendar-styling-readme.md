# Calendar-styling Readme

The codes are tested in classic and boost theme (moodle v.3.11). The last section in the CSS file for hiding the event descriptions is only tested in classic theme (moodle v.3.9.10) for the moment.

Please be careful by testing on your individual moodle-site and check out important notes on https://github.com/TRMSC/moodle-css-styling/blob/main/README.md .

---------------------

## Contents

There is a __css file__ for general styling of the calender. 

Also you can use the __inline-script__ by putting into the atto-editor. With the script you can show today's date on the calendar-block and build links to the calender-/ event-sites.

Furthermore you can do a __language customisation__ for showing the information that user entries are private.
